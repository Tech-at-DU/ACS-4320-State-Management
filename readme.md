# ACS 4320 State Management for JavaScript Apps

## Course Description

State Management for JavaScript Apps focuses on designing, implementing, and reasoning about application state in modern frontend systems. Students study how state evolves from simple local UI concerns to shared, global, server-synchronized, and persistent forms as applications grow in complexity. Through a sequence of refactors and progressively constrained projects, the course emphasizes state ownership, data flow, async correctness, and explicit modeling of application behavior. Students learn to evaluate tradeoffs between state management strategies and justify architectural decisions rather than relying on frameworks or patterns by default.

### Why you should know this

Most bugs in modern JavaScript applications are not caused by syntax errors or missing features—they come from poorly designed state. As applications grow, ad-hoc use of local state, props, and global stores leads to duplicated data, impossible UI states, stale views, and unpredictable behavior that is difficult to debug or test. Understanding state management teaches you how to design systems that remain correct as complexity increases, where data has a clear owner, changes are intentional, and user interactions are predictable. These skills transfer across frameworks and libraries and are essential for building front-end applications that scale beyond small demos into maintainable, production-level software.

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to:
	1. Analyze JavaScript applications to identify state management problems, including duplicated state, unclear ownership, and invalid UI states.
	2. Design state architectures that clearly define ownership, data flow, and state lifetimes across local, shared, global, server, and persistent state.
	3. Implement predictable state transitions and asynchronous data flows using reducers, selectors, and explicit modeling techniques.
	4. Refactor existing applications to improve state clarity, correctness, and maintainability without changing user-visible behavior.
	5. Evaluate and justify tradeoffs between state management strategies and tools through written and visual technical documentation.
